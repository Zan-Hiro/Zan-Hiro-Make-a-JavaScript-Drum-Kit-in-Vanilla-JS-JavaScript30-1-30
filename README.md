Hello,world.

I started studying programming 3 moths ago(since 2020/11/19).

And, I'm challenging JavaScript Challenge on Youtube Channel of Wes Bos.

It's my challenge rule.ðŸ”½

1: It is OK to using a starter-kit preparing by Wes Bos.(Thank you Wes)

2: But I have to codeing by myself. I don't watch Youtube Channel.

If you interested in challenge, you should check the Wes Bos Youtube Channel.
